  you   do so huh foreign  ah  hello hello today i'll be answering questions that people asked me with a website called marshmallow it's sort of like um curious cat you guys have ever seen that it's just like a place where people can send questions um i closed it this morning and you guys guess how many questions i got in total two thousand five hundred ten thousand that's a good guess is 1700 484. wait what did i just say  1748  whoops i don't know i said it like that  so i've never answered questions like this um my manager son helped me pick out some questions um but i only picked out 15. actually i think it's exactly 49 so i did not get a lot because i don't know maybe i can speed fire them i don't know i'm not sure uh but there's a lot of stuff that like i couldn't put in there like people recommending games or just people telling me nice stuff so thank you i really appreciate it the people saying hi from from like taiwan and peru and and vietnam and new jersey and argentina thank you thank you i really appreciate that uh so we have 49 questions uh i did pick them because i probably thought of something to say beforehand but my brain turns into mush when i stream  okay i will try my best hopefully we can fill up an hour with this if not we can just take questions from chat okay let's begin hi i'm blown away by your aiming skills in fps even i've played 800 hours of cs go i still suck i'm still i still stuck at nova 1 sorry i want to ask how did you train your aim well um the first fps i really played with mouse and keyboard was team fortress 2. actually i used to play it on the xbox because on the xbox they sold it as like part of the orange box and one day it was on sale for five dollars and that's how i found i found um i i i fell in love with team fortress 2 because uh but actually i didn't know in team fortress 2 so like on the xbox 360 version right of course you could play online but there's only so many things you can do there's no items it was just it was just people shooting but sometimes there were hackers in the xbox 360 lobbies and they used to put like hats on ah that was the coolest thing and then one day i told a friend i was like they put there was a hacker they put hats on people and team fortress 2 in the game and they were like you know you know you can play it on pc and you can wear hats all the time i didn't know i didn't know so yeah i i i played a lot of tf2 and um yeah you just have to you just have to play a lot i guess there's like some aim training games you can do yeah okay next question thank you  i have to wait for the song to start again congratulations on a successful debut if you had to pick one of your fellow en members to protect you from the other three would it be and why  they all have weapons nina has her tentacles ali has her scythe girl has a big fork tiara has sword and chicken protect from the other three i feel like callie would be the best one because her weapon is just the biggest but then again you know like imagine ina is like an agility type she's like agility stealth i think she would she would like do really well it's loud i'll turn it down actually i'll turn down for you guys because for me it's a good volume yeah i think either um cali or inna hi kalia yeah okay next question what was your inspiration if any for becoming content creator i love your stream so far keep up the hard work um i'm just a detective but if i had to pick um i first saw prop hunt videos on youtube somebody named donkey um and i really want i really want to have fun like that yeah next question watching your valor and apex legends you made me want to play fps again after a pretty long break from them you reminded me just how fun and wonderfully intense they can be are there any games you recommend even outside for those who stream like cs go for someone who's never played competitive mode what do you particularly enjoy about your favorite fps games um sorry  hello sorry about that um so what i enjoy about fps games um i don't know there's a lot of small details i like about fps games like switching between weapons or um and just like jumping and shooting and spamming keys but i think i enjoy fps games a lot because um i don't know there's something really satisfying against like playing against other people and then possibly dominating them with your skill isn't that so satisfying but yeah like i said um if you're new i don't know what youtube's like these days but that's how i started playing fps games and halo is pretty popular right now because it's got the re-release on pc that'd probably be a pretty good one to play doom eternal yeah i never played actually i never played doom it looks really fast-paced i probably like it i watched like a short documentary on how the music was made it's really interesting like the sound design behind it and like how they decided like certain weapons do like certain riffs and stuff it's really interesting okay next question amelia said on your daily stream you like to make a hollow live game do you have something in mind no it might not be exactly what you meant i think it'd be awesome to see hollow ian try playing uh rpg also if you like subliminal i'm just about uh really recommend antituber i got a lot of suggestions for andy chamber on twitter too i will look into it if it's similar i'll probably really like i'll i'll look into it there's a there's a one you might really want to play ah but i have to wait it hurts i want to play it so bad  anyways um for a holo en game i had an idea but i don't know if i should tell you guys because what if you steal my idea and then you do it better than me i don't want that i want to make it well if you guys promise not to do it if i say it you guys will do it i can't tell you guys it's a secret i will say this rhythm game that's all next question do you like mystery novel short stories as well as games keep up the good work and sleep um i do like to read i don't think lately i've read that many mystery novels but i like to read a lot i think reading is really good for your brain especially especially if you um like if you have to speak uh reading is good to create like an inner voice in your head and it improves your vocabulary and improves your imagination i know for some people it's hard to read because it's it's like uh you know their brain works differently when i read books it's like i'm watching a movie inside my brain so yeah if you can find i would say if you if you don't really like reading um you should start out with like a short a short story something that that is something you're interested in specifically oh next question my watching shoes have been pretty entertaining thank you and i really love your epic stream thank you recently i've been feeling a little down here she was really getting me through it i need some advice at least one of my friends has been really really down i'm going to try and help him i want to see what social discontent is for doing that you have any advice for my current situation thanks lots right now a lot of multiplayer games are really popular like among us and fall guys and other games so if your friend plays games you should try to play friends that play games together i hope more people come out with like more co-op games because i feel like it really uh is really important to interact with people sometimes you know you really need that that's why you guys are here right next question voice so sweet and deary and common and amazing what's your secret no this is these are just questions i picked to feel good about myself  uh my secret for my voice but thank you that's really nice well i drink a lot of water i drink a lot of water i only drink water i drink water a lot i went through three big jugs of water in like one week yeah that's i drink a lot of water uh smoking's bad for you don't smoke and um i don't really eat that much dairy like milk i think milk like makes your throat like maybe not milk i don't know that's really nice thank you though actually i hide right now and tea i really like iced tea actually i've been spending too much on iced tea lately but tea is like tea is just caffeinated water  caffeinated sweet water iced tea next question hello amelia hello how do you tackle doing anything when you feel too demotivated when it comes to stuff like this uh it's okay to have bad days you know you're not you're not gonna be perfect you're not gonna be a tip-top shape every single day you can't beat yourself up about it and the only way to make progress is one little tiny step at a time you're not gonna accomplish great things overnight gotta work a little bit at a time and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and then a little bit more yeah okay next question is jago best girl i mean everybody knows who ya go gogogo is of course number one that's why i keep a portrait of him on my folder so i can see it he inspires me  thank you very question uh next hello amelia chen judging from your puzzle gameplay yesterday you are interested in remarkably detective girl thank you but i wonder why you become a detective i i i like i like to help people and detective work is pretty much helping people you're solving problems to help to help others and we have a good time together i hope i can help you guys too right okay next question thank you will you play valve games like portal half-life series or tf2 i think it would be pretty fun watching you play them greetings from spain hello spain um well i've already played all the portal games um and the co-op uh and a lot of community maps um although i never actually finished half-life series i played uh about halfway through both so i've never finished both that'd be interesting to play but i don't know i don't know if people would really enjoy it i would want to try again to finish it i always would get stuck on like one part a half-life where like you drive this boat and i would keep crashing the boat and then i'd get stuck but that was a long time ago when i tried maybe that wouldn't happen to me i probably broke it about tf2 i don't know that would be fun to try one day on stream where people would join but i don't know i'm scared what if people can like find out stuff through tf2 is it safe i don't know there's hackers i don't know i have to look into it that'd be fun though i wouldn't mind can you guys guess who i like to play in tf2 i have a top three i know there's only nine can you guys guess mmo's counts fine medic heavy soldier i like to play in order sniper engineer pyro there's one map in tf2 where like there's like water on the bottom of the map where there's this bridge above it and i would sit as pyro with this neon sign and i would just electrocute people it was really fun sounding so satisfying in games i don't know why like uh in games i always like to use really bad weapons to get kills because it just feels so satisfying like in cs go i'd pretty much only use the r8 and the scout i don't know it's so fun and people get mad  okay next question thank you on average how many hours do you spend playing video games not as much as i used to like when i would play tf2 i'd play for like nine hours a day and then i played overwatch for a long time and i'd play for like seven hours a day and then i would play cs go for like six hours a day but i've been too busy to really play camps that much yeah i like to play though and i like sharing with other people it's really fun thanks for the question next  who would win in a fight callie with her wine bottle or chiara with her chicken drumsticks i feel like this question is really easy to answer a wine bottle that's glass you really hurt somebody a chicken though what are you gonna do shove it down their throat definitely a wine bottle no contest  okay next question i always put off projects until the last possible minute do you have any advice to work on projects sooner also have you tried iced tea latte it's one of my favorite kinds of drinks i've never had a chai ice chai tea latte what is a latte i've heard it but i don't drink coffee so i don't understand what it means ah so no on that one um in terms of getting your project done sooner uh i also suffer from this but when it comes to chores and stuff i know it's probably pretty similar mindset like sometimes i'll try to keep chores off for as long as possible but then i start to think well the sooner i get it done the more time i'll have afterwards to just do whatever i want so yeah and try to think of it like that like you're treating yourself later you get more time later get it done now milk coffee oh i usually get um thai iced tea i think they put milk in that because um it's like uh it's like orange it looks like cheeto milk why is that so orange it tastes so good though i had some today sometimes i think i spent too much money ordering tea but it's a caffeine as actually i was raised to be like uh very strict in terms of coming like a drinking caffeine like i was told you never want to drink caffeine because you'll get addicted to it and so i just grew up drinking water and soda burned my throat so i didn't drink soda either but iced tea all right thank you for the question teammates brown sugar boba i don't think i've had it if it's sweet i'd probably like it oh i had boba for the first time like not that long ago like maybe maybe maybe like a year ago i never had it before and the first tip i took you know how it has a big straw  when i started to drink it i i like uh i don't know how else to say this without sounding bad i sucked really hard okay and then one of the bobo balls like flew into the straw and hit the back of my throat oh the best thing about those drinks though is stabbing it like uh you stab with a little plastic yeah uh thank you for your question next asking for some advice konichiwa konichiwa uh how do i calm myself down before or during an interview oh interrogation interview  been loving your um so far looking forward to many more fun streams and adorable moments coming home lives best detective  um when it comes to interview it's really important to line up as many questions as you can um and hopefully that process like calms you down because when you're going for an interview you want to seem like you're really interested and the way to show interest is to come up with a bunch of questions beforehand you want to be the one interviewing them yeah because they want to they want to see that you're that you're invested enough to like do some research beforehand to come up with questions  yeah you want to turn the tables on them yeah uh next question uh for you what are the qualifications of a good best detective you have to be able to listen really well i think listening is a really good skill you gotta listen to what people say and sometimes when people say stuff they don't really say what they mean you gotta read in between the lines you gotta be observational uh i'm a really detail oriented person so like small things really stand out to me that's why i make a good detective thank you for the question all in luck true that too that was the best in fallout like i would always go uh half luck half melee and then i would use the uh the home run bat and if you don't know what the home run bat is in fallout it has like a 10 or like i think it's lower than 10 chance that when you hit an enemy they go flying they like fly across the map that's my favorite that's my favorite weapon to use but it's really bad like like later on in the game you can't really use it  okay next question hi mila i love your debut stream and your virtual person i like it thank you that's really nice i think it's charming answer my question how's holly end going so far is everything expected not expected or somewhere in between um well to be honest it kind of still feels like it's not real i have yet to come to terms with everything i think things are going better than expected i'm not sure but i can say that i'm really happy i'm really happy to be here and play games and have fun and talk with you guys and find cool art and reads hat and funny messages so thank you thank you i'm not crying okay next question ah moines thighs or armpits i did not why is armpits an option since when is this an option am i missing something isn't it supposed to be bowing stains and butt why armpit there's only one response and it's thighs thank you next question i'm not good at listening to english i want to study so that i can hear amelia speaking english what should i do um maybe i could do a teaching english stream but i don't know how many people would be interested in that i really like i really like um english like when it comes to punctuation and vocabulary and grammar even though when i write i don't like to use punctuation because it's too much it's too much effort and not enough payoff i really like to read so um maybe maybe i could help i don't know how i would like what a good english learning um layout would be but i could think of some stuff yes okay next what were your top five favorite video games while growing up um the first game i remember playing was mortal kombat on the sega genesis  um i used to play i don't know what to say i had older brother yeah i used to play together and i used to get really really really really really mad that's that's where it all started  i liked all the girl characters like the one that turns into a cheetah yeah i actually still have the cartridge but um we sold the sega genesis one day well i didn't at a garage sale so i don't have the console but i have the cartridge um next uh pocky and rocky this is on the snes yeah hockey and rocky it's like uh i don't know how to describe it um he likes spam you spam your little and uh you play as like a shrine maiden and uh and you fight like all these um all these um like monsters from like mythological japanese lore monsters i think yeah and that was the first time i had ever played a game where like it was co-op and i wasn't mad that i was losing  that's probably why another reason why i really like multiplayer games youkai yeah it's cool the uh the sound effects in pakiraki really nice too it has like a really specific sound to them i don't know how to describe it um my next game mario sunshine yeah i really like the music and mario sunshine ah i mean who doesn't alfino plaza  yeah mario sunshine i actually never beat mario sunshine on my own um i like watching my brother play growing up and i would like to play it on stream at some point hopefully uh what how many was that three um next game uh it's a this is not really a well-known game it's a mmorpg french mmorpg it's called dofus and it's like i don't know how to describe it it's like a turn-based mmo and uh it's like chess it's sort of like chess but you get a lot of classes and uh you have like movement points and action points yeah i i spent a lot of time playing that a lot of time i put a lot of hours into that game yeah go fist and then the last game um animal crossing yeah okay wait can i make this into two games because harvest moon and animal crossing are like up at the top for me in like the same in the same in the same category i really like harvest moon i remember um i got really sad my cow and harvest moon died and i cried all day it was really sad and then an animal crossing my my older brother used to threaten to erase my town and i would cry okay not great memories associated with that but i really like those games okay next question ah i'm really enjoying your streams what's your favorite movie also be careful here huh thank you um is this movie called hunt for the wilder people if you guys haven't seen it i really recommend it it's got like a really good soundtrack and um a really good uh cinematography and it's really funny and it's just it's really good it's a new zealand film film yeah yeah kiwi is really funny and it's got um it's got a lot of good actors in it the title hunt for the wilder people like wild wilder people yeah that movie is really good okay next question how was your debut experience did the nervosity fade away after some time into the stream and how did you come up watson's concoction um my debut stream um it seems like it was kind of divisive a lot of people were very skeptical about it um well how do i put this um there's a lot of expectations for how i should found and so i just decided to go full throttle and i said it yeah i really i wanted to i don't know why i had the inclination to do like some more technical based stuff but i still had fun i had fun doing it i thought it was a lot of fun and it's imagine okay have you guys ever been in school you like go to your first class or something and they tell you to introduce yourself and you have to get up in front of everybody and you have to tell them something okay you guys know that feeling okay imagine that times how many a lot okay i gotta get water do  do hello i'm back and moist hydrated okay moist is not the word to use  water okay next question  i do you move on for someone um this one's probably a little bit serious but i think it's important to remember if that person's not putting any effort into you why should you do do it for them your time is important okay use it wisely there's other people that are more more more more um deserving yeah probably luck thank you for your question next what kind of doggo is bubba can you guys guess based off this you know i drew this it's wonderful i love it thank you oh yeah some people i saw some people probably wondering about my hiccups um my hiccups i swallow a lot of air and then it comes up and instead of a burp it is a hiccup they're not like uh hiccup hiccups they're like upside down burps that's the best way i can describe it a retriever that's a good that's a good it's a good guess  bubba is uh a hunting terrier he likes to hunt um like a bloodhound um in his blood yeah it's in his butt hunting uh there was a there were there was a time when he used to like to kill uh rats but he doesn't do that anymore he's a good boy next question after the initial debut nervousness you transition your current calm mindset pretty seamlessly and naturally now that the divisions are done though how do you feel still nervous excited uh every time before i stream it feels like i have a giant rock inside of my tummy and in my chest i have a giant scribble that's like it's weird that's before i stream and then while i'm streaming it's like i don't know how to describe it i feel calm so i still press go live even though it hurts because i know in the end that i really enjoy it see ya thanks for the question next you have any significant memories of games or films you play saw as a child that affected you uh actually i feel like i already answered this question maybe it's sort of like a double um games or films films oh i really like the film rat race growing up i don't know that was a that was a really funny movie to me um another movie is a movie called just friends i saw that and um emily's really funny games i already said the games pretty much those games  um  i can't remember anything else yeah that's it that's all i have for now what's the best way to achieve a big goal that you're working to how should you go about it um there's a lot of questions in this one so we'll take it one time like i was saying before um if you're gonna make progress it's okay to do it a small bit at a time yeah especially uh for example i used to be someone didn't really take care of themselves i guess and slowly you just have to start building habits like one habit at a time and try not to beat yourself up about it and then it's like making a tower of legos yeah you make a small you put a few legos together and then you put a few more legos together and then you stack them up and then you stack them up and then you stack them up and you build your own fort so yeah you just have to keep building uh what makes you happy in life um i like going on walks with bubba walking the doggo yeah that's really nice um you guys should try to take walks it's good for you like seeing the outside yeah seeing the bugs the plants the sky that nice i hope you guys go outside sometimes at least yeah um and playing games it's people how much japanese do you know ah i only know very little japanese and most of it is from watching anime and hollow life so not very much now i took a japanese class i can read hiragana i know like some days of the weeks um numbers yeah words words short phrases  uh hope you have a good stream thank you next question what do you do to keep your sanity in check while investigating mythical beings more interestingly how do you keep the mythical being sanity in check while you interrogate them you see the secret was i never had any sanity at all  um i don't know they probably suck sanity from each other yeah they share their energy the next question is worse on pizza shrimp or pineapple you know pineapple pineapple pizza i actually like pineapple and pizza but only if the pizza and the pineapple are cold because fruit you should not eat fruit warm why would you want to eat warm fruit so yeah if it's cold pizza with cold pineapple i think it's all right it's kind of a weird combination the sweet and uh you know but tomato tomato sauce in itself is pretty sweet if you think about it tomatoes are fruit right so pizza already has fruit in it right uh and strip on pizza sherbet pizza actually sounds really good too okay if i had to compare them i think shrimp on pizza would be better than pineapple and pizza yeah shrimp pizza doesn't sound bad like uh like little popcorn shrimp that'd be pretty good yeah never had that before though i'm sure it's a thing somewhere okay next amelia hello you always seem to emanate a positive energy and good will how do you motivate yourself so that you may motivate others well when it comes to this it's really important to lie to yourself that makes it sound bad but i i think it's really important to tell yourself that things are good and things are gonna be okay because somebody there's never there's not always gonna be somebody there to tell you it's okay so you have to learn how to do it on your own yeah you have to learn how to get yourself out of out of that right you know i know it's hard it's easier said than done but you should repeat some phrases to yourself every you know when you're not feeling good i think that that might help um yeah thank you question next yup you're welcome  okay next uh who if your senpai is your biggest inspiration  there are so many people like everybody in hollow life puts in a ton of work and i think it's really hard to put yourself in front of people like that um so yeah everybody like if you look at everybody they each have their own qualities that you can you can be inspired from uh personally uh coco senpai is really inspiring she she puts in a lot of work and juggles a lot of stuff and and speaks english and japanese and yeah i feel like she paid the way for us so i'm really grateful for that yeah thank you coco senpai thank you yeah thank you question next i have to wait for the song to change  it's a little bit big sorry this might be a bit of a long one but i have trouble motivation to do subject for drawing practice or other hobbies do you have any advice how to find motivation and time management um yeah i think this is the same thing i was saying before you just have to start small you're not going to be great right away you gotta do little baby steps yeah and build it up build up your lego tower baby stream was amazing and it had me hooked from the start and you kept my spare tire during these times thank you birthday ah happy birthday thank you i'm glad you enjoyed it thank you i hope you're able to learn how to draw and pick up hobbies yeah and it's okay not to be good right away because you're not gonna get better unless you push through it okay next question hello amelia i'm your teammate from china you are my favorite member and hello ian and i have been uh translating your stream videos in order to make acquaintance of you thank you and i hope that more people enjoy teammates thank you and you know how to follow the youtuber look forward to my billbilly thank you wait is this a question  i want to thank people that translate well sometimes yeah it doesn't go great but sometimes they put in some work so thank you thank you thanks uh i love your shoes i just want to ask what is your favorite ryan gosling movie um i know i got a lot of questions like this but i actually do have a movie that i usually recommend to people and it's called lars and the real girl it's like one of those movies that's it's kind of hard to watch because it just makes you kind of uncomfortable but it's like a really it's a really sweet movie because i don't want to spoil it i'll do like a yeah so pretty much he he makes up this imaginary girl in his head and it becomes like this tool for him to get better and improve and improve himself and he thinks that it's her doing but it's really him and people are really accepting about it so it's a really nice wholesome movie yeah you guys should watch it if you haven't seen it next question hello emilia greeting from thailand hello thailand you guys are 100k subs thank you i'm happy when watching your streaming you make me want to learn more english thank you i hope i can help um yeah i'll do english learning streams a question i want to ask you if you had uh to investigate mr case who do you think your partner would be to help you solve the mystery and why i'm guessing from hallo en that's what i i had thought when i read this question um so i had to tell you guys something about gouda i don't think she would be a very good investigation partner i love her but get out dude i didn't know how to reset a modem i had to walk her through it so get us out um chiara i feel like kiara would would definitely help with like the the mood while investigating but i don't know should be too too keen yeah chickens you know bird brains  and ina actually i think ira would be a good uh partner in a mystery and a mystery crime investigation she has a common demeanor i think that's important when you're dealing with with uh cases and investigations you have to be calm so that you can you can properly evaluate the information yeah and kelly uh i don't know i think cali cali is the murderer instead of the investigator  i don't think she would be very helpful she'd be the one we're investigating so yeah i give it a question next what's the one japanese dish you want to try have you ever had takoyaki i had takoyaki takoyaki uh it tastes like uh barbecue meatballs i know maybe it's just the takoyaki i had i had never had um octopus before i tried takoyaki and i always heard people talk about like octopus being really chewy but when i had octopus uh i like the texture but it's not surprising because when i was a kid i like to eat sand ah anyways for japanese dish i'd like to try um i really like the okay well i guess i can't say something that i already like um i never had natto before everybody says it's like kind of weird tasting i would like to try it fermented soybean why not um what else would be good it's like a lot of different foods i can't pick one i like tamagoyaki and um now my brain is shorting out right now i can't think of anything else there's a lot of a lot of stuff  healthy i hear it's really good for you uh yeah i like to eat sand when i was a

started on the questions  ah thank you manager manager-san for helping me pick these out thank you  okay the first question any tips on how to play viper from valorant um the way i play viper is i

and um i order stuff online that's pretty fun uh order stuff um i'll talk to my family and what else yeah i usually just like read in bed maybe i'll catch up on an anime yeah i usually read more manga than i watch anime because i'm pretty picky and today i watched the uh last episode of decadence i'm not gonna spoil it but i cried i really i like that anime i mean you know it's not like the best anime ever but that was pretty good i liked it they're really cute characters  okay next question hi watson if you had a choice uh would you rather go on a date to an aquarium or a zoo asking for a friend this is like a friendly date right like uh friends get together and your friends and you go you go somewhere cool as friends yeah um personally i would prefer to go to the aquarium the aquariums like that's a really nice atmospheric you know like oh the blue lights it's all like dark oh yeah the aquarium's way better and you get to see like colorful weird animals they got octopuses and squid and octopi and shark yeah yeah you got gouda and ina yeah cuttlefish you know looks like a cuttlefish doesn't she cuddly cuddly i'll thank you for the question uh next a next slide please shark they got shark hello uh your previous q a inspired me to do better and one of the steps i take is to become less picky eater i've been once since i was a child i've it's disrupted my social life since i had to run away dealing it with it until now have you ever been a picky eater did you ever get over it or do you have any tips on how to do so um yeah actually like in my debut i said that i didn't like peppers but recently i've come to really like peppers yeah i don't know i've i just i guess instead of the the taste like when you eat something that you're new to eating or like you don't think you would like you should try to focus on the texture of it because like the textures can be really interesting um personally i can't really do stuff that's like um slimy i guess yeah like stuff that's too squishy i don't really like but if it's got like some crunch to it yeah it's got a nice texture focus on texture like i didn't used to like olives but um the texture of olives is really nice yeah it's got like a little bite to it but it's like kind of squishy  crunch the crunch i don't like mushrooms mushrooms um i think mushrooms uh this sounds weird but mushrooms like look really cute right but then the texture of them it's like uh kind of rubbery i guess i don't know maybe i just haven't had well cooked mushrooms or something yeah  i like i like how they smell like earthy okay next question what oh this one kind of ties into what i was just saying uh what what are some of your favorite smells um i like the smell of gasoline even though it's bad for you i like the smell of sharpies and paint even though it's bad for you and i like the smell of fresh cut grass and usually when i buy like lotions or uh conditioner and stuff um i like i like i like uh the smell of coconut yeah coconut smells really nice yeah when it comes to scents usually i pick like a coconut or like a pineapple oh also this one's kind of weird um but i kind of like how like uh farms smell you know like um like barns i guess like uh yeah i guess farm animals not like i would want to smell it all the time but i don't know it's just like that earthy smell yeah it's kind of a weird one they'll make fun of me okay next question  papaya  i hope you're doing well i hope you're doing well too hello uh what's the first thing you do after you wake up in the morning like is there any specific ritual you do every day uh do you feel like you really started your day also always enjoy your streams love you oh thank you i'm glad you're enjoying the streams um when i wake up um i check my phone i check my phone and then i pet bubba and wellington yeah and then i drink water because i get really dehydrated when i wake up like my mouth is like really dry and then um yeah that's pretty much it and then i lay in bed for like an hour  okay thank you for a question uh next question oh also then when i actually wake up i take bubba for a walk yeah okay next question hold on one second okay next slide please hi davido hello one second   sorry somebody's making noise outside what okay uh been following watch your shoes from malaysia hello malaysia hello i'm not sure i haven't mentioned before but do you have any favorite music artists do you like any particular genre of music um uh i usually don't listen to that much music um but i do have like some that i i like i like any music that has um horns in it yeah i really like like uh uh brass instruments i guess they're called or woodwind instruments um yeah stuff the instruments that people blow into yeah all of those like trumpet saxophone a trombone uh missing one i'm missing what is the one i'm missing  flute i don't know yeah and um i actually really like like how you guys played uh tony hawk uh pro skater 2. it has like a lot of music called ska in it i really like i really like that genre of music yeah like uh you can bounce to it you can dance yeah it's got like some punk vibes to it yeah i like some jazz music but i don't have any artists specifically for jazz that i like but in general overall i would say um that i like it yeah and a lot a skull comes from the uk you guys know that yeah um i like scott and then also um like because i i watch some anime um i'll listen to like uh uh anime opie and idi's like openings and the endings and yeah sometimes i'll listen to uh ost like soundtracks from games or for movies too yeah i like the wally soundtrack the wally soundtrack is really nice yeah  and some remixes like some uh some anime song remixes and stuff like that yeah okay uh oh oh and i like uh and i like like a city pop a city pop shark and um like uh what is it uh     wait what is i remember the name yeah i get a lot of uh playlists like that recommended to me to youtube but i just listened to them i like i like groovy sounding music like stuff you can dance too yeah okay next question future fun yeah you have any tips for motivation i can't get anything done um for motivation oh yeah this one's a tough one because like it doesn't matter what people tell you you just have to come to your own conclusion or else it doesn't really mean anything i guess uh but you can have yeah some tips help yeah uh you should just okay doesn't sound dumb but if you force yourself to do it that's pretty much what you have to do you have to force yourself like if you have chores you don't want to get done you're like i'd rather i'd rather rather watch my favorite my favorite hololive streamer yeah well you know go wash the dishes make yourself wash the dishes first and then you have earned the freedom to watch whatever you want okay you gotta make yourself do it first yeah and then you have free time afterwards i have play time afterwards  uh you could watch and watch at the same time that's true  yeah you guys i'm telling you to wash your dishes but i've had dishes in my sink for like the last three days actually they might be longer  okay next question hi i'm a listener from korea hello korea like me they said i'm gonna take a step away from the happiness and power love right smile thank you and thank you i'm glad you're improving here's a question uh i have uh you have to fall asleep very fast watch how i've been streaming in korea it's very painful i can't sleep with you sleep now is there any special way to fall asleep that's the question is there a trick to falling asleep um there's one that rhymes um i don't think i can say that one uh i would say make sure you have like a like a ritual i guess like a habit you form a habit and um yeah so brush your teeth wash your face get a cup of water and then you know maybe give yourself a little free time to read on your phone yeah some people use asmr to sleep that's a good one i have a nice uh goodnight asmr video you could listen to but yeah make like a habit and then also this was a really good tip i read somewhere but try not to use your bed like throughout the day or like only use your bed when you're going to go to sleep because then your brain it'll be like turning on a switch you get to your bed and your brain is like oh okay time to sleep yeah maybe you shouldn't use your phone in bed i say that but i spend like two hours in bed on my phone yeah some people some people say tea is really good um too help yeah it's got like uh some sleepy properties in the tea to make you want to sleep yeah you can try some watson's concoction specialty yeah all right thank you for the question next ah hiya hello uh do you usually cook for yourself or do you usually do restaurant takeout uh what sort of stuff do you uh like when you cook and otherwise um i try not to order food because um it really adds up you know you got to be careful so i only order food like maybe two times a week and then i cook um i don't have that many ingredients for cooking i just have i just make like the same three meals pretty much whatever i cook uh i have four pounds of pasta and i use i i take from it every once in a while and i make spaghetti i have this giant jar of red sauce uh yeah so i make a lot of spaghetti and you guys know when you have spaghetti the best way to eat it is you you don't mix the sauce in you put you put the noodles on your plate and then you put a spoonful of sauce on top of it yeah and then when you eat it the sauce gets on the spaghetti yeah that's pro tip um otherwise i make um curry yeah i like to make uh the japanese curry um i'm not really good at spicy food so it's like the sweet one the mild one and i make that with potatoes and carrots and bacon that's the amelia special curry yeah maple bacon and curry tastes really good i think it's kind of weird i don't think most people put bacon in curry but uh it's pretty good  yeah it's good so i usually use like uh i'm too lazy to peel potatoes so i buy canned potatoes and i buy like the little carrots and then i chop them up and i cook them with the bacon and then i put the curry in yeah they're like the roux yeah cheese put cheese on the curry what is that a thing you don't have some questionable food  taste i guess it's just what they eat down in in atlanta atlantis yeah very questionable that's a thing it's good oh i never had that before i've never seen that before and then the other meal i usually cook is uh i make a turkey sandwich just toasted bread with turkey and mayo and then um i usually have it with a side of like these instant noodles where it's like mostly broth uh yeah it's really good um and then otherwise i order like a chicken sandwich from like a restaurant or like uh i really like um they're called silver noodles vermicelli yeah i most thai places will have those yeah so i like i like those too okay next question  what kinds of art do you like the most are there any artists who inspire you um i'm really bad with remembering names like names for anything like actors or directors or artists uh yeah i'm really bad with remembering names so i don't have any oh i like the uh the artist who did the um art for girls last tour tk miss i think that's like her twitter handle um yeah she i like that type of art where it's like very sketchy like rough i guess raw looking like the i don't want to say unclean but it's not like that it's just a sketchy yeah i like i like that sort of look where it's like gritty yeah very sketchy lines and and uh interesting color combinations stuff like that yeah  uh i don't know the exact twitter handle i think somebody in chat yeah some people are talking about it yeah okay thank you for the question next  uh how did you learn to commentate csgo valor matches so well the speed and detail you live comment answers is impressive um so i used to watch like a lot of the overwatch pro league and um i just picked up on uh how they commentate i guess like uh the the patterns and and calling out stuff so i guess it wasn't specifically for csgo or valerian but mostly just watching the overwatch league yeah yeah okay next question thank you  uh when does membership come out i'm too excited waiting for that i can't wait any longer um because of this question i will uh try to work on it tonight and tomorrow i'll spend on most of my time doing that after tonight's stream i haven't really i have to make a lot of things i think for it so i'll uh i'll work on it yeah yeah i'll work on it i want to get it out bye what's today wednesday uh i want to get it out by  a monday tuesday maybe the weekend if i can do it in time yeah i don't want to like half-ass it i guess i want to make sure that i have like some good some good perks in there for you guys yeah thank you for the question do you have any advice on how to be more confident um well be more confident it's true what they say like when they say fake it until you make it pretty much it doesn't mean like uh be a fake person but like amplify some of your qualities that you're comfortable with yeah it's good to identify the qualities that you're comfortable with and then it's like putting them it's like uh putting them through a megaphone yeah pretty much that all right thank you uh next question alcohol okay that might help maybe not too much of it though okay uh we heard about your disney dream and you mentioned the bus stream now what's the craziest dream you remember well i have a lot of dreams my dreams are very very very active i'll have like two to three dreams at night um and they're really they're really crazy but last night i had a dream yeah because i was in ina stream and she's like how was your sleep and i said oh i i had a nice sleep i was dreaming about buses so i had this dream that i was on like a school bus and there was this lady bus driver and i was talking to her and she was like um a really good bus driver and i was like how did you become such a good bus driver like i can't even drive the car well how did you learn how to drive a bus and she's like i don't know i guess i was just born for this and then she did like this sick trick where she she was like she put the bus on autopilot and then she she ran out of the bus and then she ran around this building and did a flip and then she went back into the bus while i was still driving and like jumped in and did like an action like slide into the bus and then yeah it was pretty cool anyways next next question oh uh how did you develop such insane reflexes is it the concoctions or simply years of gaming and hello from the philippines hello the philippines um reflexes um i don't know like growing up i always liked sports and stuff and my brother was really into sports and he would like be like uh mom tell amelia to play football with me make her throw the football with me and so i would like have to play sports and i think it just kind of trained my reflexes yeah and it helped helped with when i started playing games yeah  next question  you said before that everyone's success looks different i was wondering if you could give any advice as to how people can achieve their own success and also realize when they have it so glad to find you first holly and jet can't wait to see great things you'll do in the future thank you that's really nice when it comes to your own slice of success yeah everybody's circumstances are different so it's gonna look like way different for everybody but i think if you're doing something uh that puts a smile on your face and and as long as you're not hurting other people yeah um that that could be success maybe something as simple as that something that makes you laugh yeah and something that makes you a lot of money yeah  thank you for the question next a detective must be in shape for any circumstance that might happen true this is very true uh what sports or physical routines does she enjoy do i enjoy um i like to stretch a lot you know uh stretching is really important especially um well you know i'm a time traveler so i don't really have to worry about this but you know as you start to get older you gotta stretch those muscles yeah you guys should remember to stretch uh you're sitting down for long periods of time especially you gotta remember to stretch um yeah i like stretching a lot and then also sometimes i go for a jog with bubba and i have a yoga mat i haven't done yoga in a while but yoga is pretty good too that's pretty much stretching so yeah i would recommend stretching i want i want to play tennis i need a tennis partner um tennis is fun yeah stretching is a sport yeah it is uh-huh  well i like tennis but i haven't played it in a while yeah now thank you for the question next amelia hello if you are hypothetically some kind of time traveler uh will there be any reason to choose to live in 2020 over every other year thanks for the streams they really keep me entertained i'm glad you're enjoying the streams uh as for your question well i think we all know 2020 uh well you know it's been you know and so i decided to time travel um to investigate the strange happenings in 2020 and to help uh people and hopefully make them laugh yeah that's why i chose 20 20. thank you for your question did your hiccups get a lot of attention growing up um actually i haven't been hiccuping for that uh long i guess i think it started like uh three or four years ago yeah um people don't really notice them in real life i guess yeah like i mean when i'm outside of the office and my detective office yeah most people don't notice them that much uh no nobody really comments on it you guys are the only ones that uh clip them and make four minute long compilations  uh well thank you for the question uh  next any plans do karaoke stream in the future amelia chan uh thank you for the question uh i would like to do more karaoke but it's a little bit tough for um special reasons um yeah hopefully uh i i if i do want to have to do like a lot of pre-planning and it becomes like a a process maybe with membership only streams it might become easier um i have to look into it yeah but i would like to do more karaoke streams yeah thank you for the question what do you think of the teammates ah the teammates you guys uh you guys make me laugh yeah is that a good thing or a bad thing that's a good thing yeah look pretty good um yeah i think you guys are really pretty nice so far yeah it will be pretty nice yeah thank you teammates for behaving for the most part for the most part thank you teammates uh next question  what's the cheapest way to sim simply you without uh it getting annoying most of your streams start between midnight 2 am over here so general interaction with chat is usually not an option especially when you're starting a lot of streams of surgery drawing coupons what other stuff would get a smile out of you i actually got this question a lot which is why i decided to pick it um yeah a lot of people want to know how they can support um the stream if they can't like uh you know do super chat which is fine that's fine and if you can't watch um well there's always uh yeah they brought up the coupons i like seeing um i know they're counterfeits but it's funny to see um homemade coupons the cool thing with coupons is that um anyone could make their own coupons yeah so i like seeing the coupons those uh those cheer me up and um uh you can watch uh like uh the archive videos or you can comment or uh interaction on twitter is good too yeah i know it's hard because there's so many so many teammates but um yeah i like coupons and especially when it comes to fan art and stuff um i like i like to appreciate the fan art too because i just imagine somebody putting a lot of time into it even if you know maybe they're not that skilled or they're still learning um i still appreciate the time and effort that they put into it to finish it yeah uh it takes it takes a lot of uh uh what is it called not motivation not work ethic uh determination yeah it takes a lot of determination to finish it and then show it to somebody thank you for the question  dedication determination both of those fit yeah hi amelia hello enjoying your content and the rest of holiday english a lot just curious on your first video game and console uh and if your first video game wasn't shooting game uh what was the game that got you into should just keep a thing in work i guess i answered this one live stream um thank you for the question um the first consoles i remember playing um the first one was the sega genesis and super nintendo and i played mortal kombat and um now one where he has the cat tail i think it's two um yeah those are the two i remember playing um earliest earliest not a boomer i'm a time traveler even as a baby i was a time traveler  and as for shooter games um  um ah yes actually uh a previous room i said i didn't grow up with a playstation but i did have a playstation 2. yeah and i think it was uh ratchet and clank rachman clank was the first uh online shooter game i ever played and they had like a mode where you could go against people and use like the really funny guns to like turn people into snowmans and stuff and i remember that was the coolest i remember playing it for the first time and i thought it was like the coolest thing ever that you could play against other people yeah i think it was jack and dax oh no ratchet and clank or jack and dax i get them both mixed up because they have two names in the title i think it was ratchet and clank yeah yeah uh i think of a question next next see commenting a lot of fan art every day on twitter do you have uh that automatic gallery in your office uh do you enjoy fan art i get easily discouraged and try drawing stuff but i've been trying my best i can't quite afford to chat that's totally okay if you can't super chat that's fine yeah fan art um i mean just chatting um yeah just chatting and commenting is or watching it's good enough but uh yeah if you want to do fan art and like go the extra mile i really appreciate it like i said before um every time i see fan art i think of you know the person who was making it and how much time they spent and how much thought they put into it and yeah i guess i i appreciate it um for that aspect more more than anything yeah because it's a it's a it's a person behind it putting in a lot of effort um for us yeah um yes yes uh and also the gallery is not automatic no you cannot put some weird thing in the hashtags and make it show up on stream that's come on we learned our lesson thank you for the question next uh do you sleep on your side back or belly uh the lure must deepen um i fall asleep on my side um hugging a pillow um but then i wake up on my dummy yeah next question  hello amelia things have settled since the day of you hopefully are feeling well i feel pretty good thank you uh still enjoying more crazy since like the coupon machine the concoction trip along with your thematic handling of the collabs i was learning how after we might see content like that again thank you for reading thank you for sending a question um yeah i have actually i have a lot of ideas for stuff um but i'm just waiting to settle in you know like get more comfortable with um scheduling and the flow of everything and then i have a lot of ideas for a lot of different things yeah my brain is always worrying with like some new uh stupid thing that i probably shouldn't do on stream  yeah i really like uh doing like the technical stuff um behind those sorts of streams so um yeah my brain is always thinking of new ideas like how to incorporate um different stuff yeah thank you for the question uh next since you like first person shooters on pc ever thought about trying to play one that you can mod the other hollow miss girls into i realize you don't have official 3d models yet um theoretically certainly co-opting my left for dead um models custom models uh i've been like otherwise that gives me many others but thank you uh hold on one second  ah i ate too many kit kats my throat  okay um uh actually i have looked into before like putting models into uh source engine um like gary's mod and left 4 dead 2. um on my left 4 dead 2 i have a lot of i had a lot of mods like one that turns uh the uh the uh the one that jumps on your head into uh diddy kong and then also one that turns the tank into strike and also one that turns ellis into glados and some anime mods um but uh because i've tried it before it's like pretty difficult um it was pretty difficult for me to try to get a model in so personally i wouldn't do it but but if you guys did it i would totally use the mods yeah i think left 4 dead 2 would be fun to play um but because it's four player co-op we might be able to do versus where maybe it's like three of us um that are going to like safe houses and then two of us play as like the the hunters yeah all right thank you for the question next hello emily i always have fun watching your streams thank you uh what kind of advice would you give someone shows low self-esteem um it's pretty much like the confidence one yeah uh hopefully you can try to ignore it as best you can and find the qualities that that uh make you feel good and amplify it like a megaphone and then use those to push the bad thoughts out yeah thank you for the question next uh greetings from my broadway from algeria hello algeria i've been watching your shoes and i love how positive fun and excited you are i'm seeing how modifying my culture on us uh i want to know if you read any visual novels and if so which ones would you say are your favorites  well actually um i really like uh i like automate all my games uh there are some visual novels that i'd like to play like i heard steins gate is pretty good um i like to play the steins gate visual novel um and i really like doki doki literature club that was an experience yeah that one's a really fun one and then um there's someone tell me games that i like yeah i won't name any specifically okay thank you next question wait actually i think that's it yeah those are all the questions all right well um  there are um a lot of questions in the marshmallow and i don't know if i should um like leave it open or um just open it because i think i'll do this like once a week um where we read questions but uh yeah maybe next week if your question wasn't picked this week maybe next week a question will be picked again um i think i'll close it for today and then i'll open it again the day before and um well it's gonna sound like a cheat kind of but the way it works that like uh usually we'll scroll through the most recent ones so and you have to be lucky like if you put it in if you put it in like right before the stream sort of like a few hours before yeah hold on one second  um you can submit the questions i have the link on my twitter um yeah manager said goes through it and then i go through it and um we pick questions that we like and because it's ranked uh from like most recent to least recent um yeah it's kind of rigged in that respect uh so if your question wasn't picked this week uh we'll try again next week yeah all right thank you guys for watching my q a um hold on there we go okay i know this one was a shorter uh stream but i'm going to go over super chats and then um get ready for the call of duty war zone stream which will be tonight um in

probably fine she trusts me okay she trusts me i can make i'm a big guy i can i can pick my own questions you'll be fine  okay  okay let's get started i got some my questions here i'm ready i think uh they're probably fine hi amelia do you have any plans to play minecraft along with other hollow live en members i'm loving your shoes much love from philippines hello from the philippines uh yes i would like to play minecraft uh personally minecraft for me is like a little bit sleepy because i'm not really sure like uh you know i don't know what to do but if i'm playing with other people be fun and the minecraft music is so relaxing it makes me sleepy yeah oh you had to hiccup  yeah it makes me sleepy but uh yeah if i play with other people chiara can teach me how to play oh that'd be fun if we all play together yeah that would be really fun actually yeah i would definitely play with them yeah thank you for the question okay and next question what's the longest you've played a video game on one sitting um actually i don't know if this is the longest but it was pretty recent uh when animal crossing came out there were two separate occasions where i stayed up for more than 24 hours playing animal crossing the new animal crossing the new horizons yeah when i got terraforming i stayed up for like 24 hours straight working on my island  i think i ended up playing for longer than 24 hours yeah i really i really like animal crossing but i haven't logged in a long time uh anyways uh thank you for the question thank you do you have any favorite musical instruments and are there any that you wish you could play if so do you think you'll ever be able to set time aside to learn it thanks and have a wonderful day wow thank you you too um i wish i could play the piano yeah i'm learning it i feel like if i were to learn an instrument i really want to learn you know like the basic basics like music theory and stuff uh yeah so i want to learn piano but um i probably won't have time to do it um because i got a lot of stuff to do a lot of cases to solve um but you know um you know later later on at some point i would love to learn yeah i know like a little bit i can play like uh i can play uh a super mario bros song on the melodica yeah i can play that one in melodica  um harmonica oh yeah ever since i was a kid i always like to collect stuff that makes sounds or like uh like uh weird sounds or like uh little tiny instruments and i would collect harmonicas even though i didn't know how to play them and i'd also collect um train whistles you guys ever have a train whistle they're pretty cool uh anyways thank you for the question uh cause you i don't like kazoo that much no i could probably play the kazoo though i'll try to get one yeah i'll get one i try to play kazoo for you guys oh and trumpet yeah trump is really cool i like listening to trumpet but i know if i'd be too good at playing it i know how to play a little bit of guitar but with guitars like the uh the neck of the guitar is too like thick usually especially for acoustic guitars uh so it's really hard for me to learn yeah i think i need like um like i've seen actually i've seen guitars that are like the size of like a big ukulele uh yeah if i had a smaller guitar i think it would be easier to do like chords and stuff because it was it was too yeah it was too big too thick yeah i want to play the drums but i feel like i wouldn't have the uh coordination for that uh playing drums is really impressive yeah playing the drums and making it sound good as a skill  i have rhythm i have rhythm i just don't know like when to use what you know like when do you use the snare when do you use the symbol when do you use the big one when you use the little one you know when you use the cowbell okay next question is it true that you were fired from your previous detective agency for misconduct this is a rumor that i have to squash ah definitely not those are false allegations i decided to quit on my own terms okay i was the one who i wasn't fired i quit i quit before they could fire me okay next question have you ever played any card games for example magic gathering or yu-gi-oh um uh growing up um i used to collect yu-gi-oh cards yeah uh well actually not me my brother used to collect yugioh cards but i was there too so i pretty much collected your cards and we used to go to card stores and we used to look for um different cards like have you guys ever been to a card store and they got like this big box and i got all the cards lined up and you gotta pull each card out individually you check what it is it was really fun um my favorite card my favorite yo-yo card was uh uh it's called the mokimoki king is like this big marshmallow and he had wings and a cute face yeah that's my favorite card  anyways uh um we also used to collect pokemon cards yeah pokemon and yu-gi-oh cards but i never i never really got into playing the game um with the card games yeah i just i just like the cards because they were pretty you're cute yeah or cool yeah yeah okay next question thank you uh i know you talked about how art of you makes you feel but what about all those fans making memes and clips uh slash translations for you ah meme review when uh thank you for the question uh clips and memes uh okay well about clips okay listen yesterday yesterday yesterday i was really tired okay so i got really angry while i was playing i don't like to get angry when i play games i don't like to get mad or salty or tilted usually i can't avoid it but like when i'm tired my brain filter my brain starts to melt and ah the salt yeah uh i did not like seeing clips of my raging  because i know i can do better i can i can control myself better so um when it comes to clips and stuff like that i didn't like to see it i don't like to see it but um i think everybody puts in a lot of hard work like i saw somebody made like a cool frag video for me for apex and um it was really funny they put like memes and stuff in it yeah i like that video it's nice um yeah uh i don't really mind um clips and stuff like that i know people put a lot of hard work into it so i appreciate it yeah it's pretty much like free marketing so i had makeup hold on  and translation yeah that's really nice that uh you do translation as long as you know you keep it accurate you do your best um yeah i really appreciate it uh so thank you um i don't know about doing meme review uh i thought it'd be a good idea to do a coupon inspection but i'm gonna wait so you guys can uh um gather all the fake coupons yeah um gather them and definitely don't make them um because we're gonna look for counterfeits yeah yeah i released some underground ones now we'll be able to tell you guys will be able to tell we'll see you'll find the secret so i can show you guys how to how to spot a counterfeit okay uh thank you for the question next if you were to be an animal what would you be and why i don't know when i read this question for some reason i had the idea it'd be really cool to be a rhinoceros um but then probably not because it's like really hot and get hunted so probably not a rhinoceros probably a bird yeah i think i like to be a bird um maybe like a seagull yeah maybe a seagull or like a uh  oh one of those seahawks yeah one of those uh sea eagles yeah maybe an eagle something that can fly fast and far yeah that'd be cool i'd like to be a bird no not a chicken not a chicken  a sea eagle seagull a seagull a falcon yeah falcon that sounds cool  now because i've seen those videos where like the the whales will play with penguins or something and then they'll like eat them yeah that doesn't sound fun okay thank you next question oh maybe a dolphin and being a dolphin would be pretty fun oh yeah like a fish like an eel yeah or like a deep sea animal no a sea turtle no um yes the dolphin dolphin okay next uh yuri or yaoi uh if you're do you accept a girlfriend i'm sorry i already have a four girlfriends i like both thank you for the question next uh do you have any stuffed plushies i do i have um i have a blue penguin i have a total i'm looking at them right now i have a totoro i have um a black kitty cat and then i have this um long cat it's like a long cap pillow can you can you still call it a ducky ducky it's just a long cat and i sleep with it and it's like the perfect pillow so i have like a regular pillow and then i have my cat pillow and my cat pillow like supports my neck because regular pillows suck and uh my cat pillow is the best because it's like the perfect size to hold yeah my cat pillow yeah thank you for the question buenos dias buenos dias i think enjoy your streams it's your amazing debut thank you was your first exposure to anime and or manga i hope you keep delivering more of your great content in the future ah thank you thank you thank you it's really nice um well for for anime um my brother really liked uh dragon ball z and i liked sailor moon and we used to watch pokemon and yugioh and digimon um yeah so those count right yeah those count and then um like i said before uh iniasia is what it got me um more hooked there's also one called obama star racers um that one's really cool i really like the uh aesthetic i guess of that one um sorry says yeah and then uh cowboy bebop and um kogias and oh full metal alchemist yeah um all those ones i used to air and then for manga because i was watching anime i like uh go on the computer and i google how to draw anime and then um i found manga yeah and i read a lot of manga like fruits baskets and uh skip a beat and yeah there's a lot of other ones yeah okay uh thank you for your question next how often do you shower every week be honest hi okay so for a while i used to not shower that often okay it's pretty bad you guys got a shower now now i shower every day or every two days yeah but uh for a while i would only shower like once a week but those days are over those days are long gone uh water under the bridge uh very it's been the past that's the old detective i'm a new shiny detective now yeah yeah now we shower every day shower every day gang right right  i'll thank you for the question next uh congratulations to educate subscribers uh just wondering why you picked purdue for your daily stream my neighbor loves this song any other songs you'd like to sing sneak peek on songs for karaoke stream uh looking forward to a teammate for life thank you teammate thank you for your question ah put it in um hold on put it put it in um uh i just like that song i didn't pick it for any specific reason um yeah i just like that song it's like one of the songs i got stuck in my head so i knew like a lot of the lyrics and um because i knew the lyrics i knew i could sing it and yeah i used to have the uh ringtone version as my ringtone for a while  and uh as for the karaoke yes that's right we have karaoke uh in two days uh i haven't picked out a song list yet but i'll probably pick some songs that i'm comfortable with uh so i was thinking about doing like a few fallout songs because um i like the fallout songs but i don't know if there's karaoke versions of them so like a few of the songs that are in fallout and then um i grew up listening to like some uh rock or uh john denver song so like something like that um yeah uh country roads i like that song and then uh maybe like a queen song or something um and then probably some weave songs yeah i will figure it out yeah i'll figure it out i'll i'll make a list that's just a sneak peek though yeah i'll try my best i try my best your ears might encounter some damage warning okay  okay thank you next question uh i don't know how you dive into situations i immediately have second thoughts uh is regularly putting yourself outside of comfort zone something you enjoy thank you thank you my question um yes actually i do like to challenge myself uh because i feel like you can't really grow unless uh you put yourself in some new situations to challenge yourself uh when it comes to like actually going outside and doing stuff i don't really go out of my comfort zone but when it comes to uh you know like uh online stuff uh yeah yeah yeah um yeah i just like to challenge myself i think that's pretty much it um yeah new experience so yeah oh thank you for the question okay okay i'm doing some teeth  goodness i'm streaming she finished streaming already i was watching her play fall guys she made like a she made like a her name into an acronym the g stands for i forgot what she did it's like a giant giant underwater i remember a gamer gamer okay a  giant underwater rubber animal yeah  ice yummy okay uh i'm convinced that a magnifying glass is practically useless what are five things you can do with a magnifying glass well good question you can burn your enemies with the sun you can use it as a paper weight you can use it to hold down a key you can use it to hold down the w key yeah you can use it to read read and then you can use it um to poke your enemies yeah yeah leave a question next yeah you could also use it as a hammer that's a pretty good one uh i just wanna ask if you're a time traveler then what kind of time machine do you use also what's your favorite time machine in media epoch from kernel trigger uh great question actually that's a really good question yeah um i don't know if you guys saw this but you see this clock right here this is a magical clock yes not magical it's sci-fi a sci-fi clock and um this turned those thingy and it goes and i set the time and i go  that's just an example of how the time machine um works yeah uh okay think of a question next  i notice you like playing with special effects and likes uh have you guys checked your art tag quite a bit oh also yes uh i haven't checked in the last few days i'm sorry uh an art lover yes yes yes uh do you have any forms of visual art you enjoy doing drawing scum sculpting or film and i actually like to edit videos a lot yeah um it's weird because if you're doing stuff like live i don't know what to call it but um doing like live effects and stuff like that i have a lot of ideas that i plan on um implementing um in the future and uh yeah i really like to edit videos um i just like to make like a combined like music and and visual stuff together a lot yeah like visuals and music um combining them i really like doing that um i i used to draw a lot i haven't really been drawing that often um we should do a drawing stream i i'm not like uh i'm not that bad at i'm not too bad at drawing i'm all right uh nowhere near even enos level but i'm not not too bad you know uh yeah i like drawing i just haven't done it lately uh i've tried sculpting before i'm really bad at it i don't know i thought i would be better at it but maybe i just have to practice um yeah i think that pretty much sums it up yeah i like uh i like lights and pretty pretty shiny stuff yeah i drink some more tea  i'm really bad at drawing though like um with other people watching because i get really distracted because i start thinking like oh i should i should say something instead of focusing on drawings i really have to focus to get it like to look good i don't know how ina does it it's really a skill to be able to uh draw and talk at the same time and like and like uh interact yeah it's a skill it's hard oh yeah yeah i said this yesterday but um i didn't actually have to use like my pantyhose or socks or like a shirt or anything for the tee because it turns out i already had the thing that i needed the strainer thingy the little strainer ball um so yeah it worked out fine and it's like this little it's like a golden snitch it like splits in half and you put the tea leaves inside and then you close it and then you put it in the water yeah so my tea is not weird or lewd there's nothing lewd about pantyhose you guys know what pantyhose is because it's pretty much pants that are socks okay it's not load stop okay next question hello amelia since you're alive since your first you first made your debut just over two weeks ago your bus size and fan arts has increased dramatically you have anything to comment on the matter um well when i watch uh when i when i consume what i uh when i see um when i see art um i personally uh you know the big old

thank you next question hi amelia hello you happen to have an arch m of yours just like sherlock holmes and james moriarty yes actually i don't know if you've heard of this name yet but calliope mori arty  that's my arch nemesis but she's also my what um my friend and my arch nemesis we have a love-hate relationship  thank you next question hey amelia hello uh your streams and tech support moments are great they're a perfect past time for that for when work is slow aside from anime what other types of shows you like thank you i'm glad i can keep you company while you're bored um what shows um to be honest um i mostly just watch anime and um i usually don't even watch that much like i'll watch some currently airing stuff or like um you know a show that really stands out to me um but i don't really consume that much content yeah um i mostly just like to work on stuff and read like i'll read a lot of manga um read play games and i like to think a lot yeah i spend a lot of time doing nothing except just thinking um so i don't really watch that much i don't really watch how much stuff but i am planning to watch that new um the new enola homes i think somebody said was called yeah on netflix i like to watch that um i usually don't really watch so much stuff yeah  uh i do like to watch movies i like to watch movies a lot but um usually i don't really think like to do that with my time beforehand yeah yeah i like to think a lot yeah and thank you for the question though number one investigator this halloween is coming up i was wondering if you're a fan of horror and spooky stuff if so what are some of your favorite horror films slash games uh thanks for watching so far i always look forward to them thank you that's really nice uh i'm actually not a fan of horror or spooky stuff  but that makes it better doesn't it um i am planning i'll i will play some scary games for um this coming october probably closer to halloween not just like all of october yeah probably closer to halloween i'm also planning to do like a special event stream that will be um scheduled and announced uh after i think it through a bit more and then um yeah yeah i'm gonna have a special event and then also i plan uh dressing up a few times during halloween yeah uh maybe we could do like some sort of event for like trick-or-treating or something if we could figure out how to do something like that that would be fun like virtual secrets eating that would be fun yeah um so yeah uh i do plan on playing some horror games uh for halloween yeah thank you for the question next what is your favorite otome game i like haku okay actually i didn't translate the top part so i'm just gonna skip this question really quick just in case but um i do really like kaku yeah hello um i always i only started playing um sort of recently so i only played through the main main um the main route i guess the reason why it's called hakuoki uh oh what's his name  i've mentioned this before but i did like um night shade but there's only one character that i liked in it and yeah i really like that character um there were a few others that i played but those are the only two that stand out to me  uh yes okay anyways uh thank you for the question um what type of table do you use i'm looking for a sturdy brand that won't break easily and it seems to have a pretty good one um i have an ikea and i can't desk yeah you can go to ikea and you can pick out like the top part of the table and then pick out like a bottom part and you can like mix and match and as long as they can attach into each other um yeah so it's like a i don't know oh oops um it's like a i don't know what is this table so it's wood it's definitely wood uh yeah it's pretty good you just find a frame and you mix and match and you can put it together and as long as it you know doesn't collapse it's fine yes okay thank you for the question next are you going to watch any upcoming anime uh yes actually one of my favorite series golden kamui they have a new season coming out i'm not exactly sure what day it starts but i know it comes out this season and it does start this october so i'm really looking forward to it i really like all the characters in golden kumui i think that's what really um makes it makes the anime good like the characters are really interesting and they're really funny and i like the story and yeah i really like the characters they're very likable but they're like they're like really flawed characters at the same time but that's what makes them really likeable yeah i really like golden kumi and then also um i never watched the original the higashi but i saw the trailer for it and it looks really interesting so i like to watch that um so i'll probably watch i'll follow along with that one um and then i saw that uh no beliefs was also getting an enemy which is interesting because that's one of the one of the uh manghwa that i've read um that'll be interesting to see so i'll definitely check that one out and then there was also moriarty one there was a moriarty anime um coming out this season  i don't remember the name yeah something like that but it looks really interesting and the main character's kind of you know cute and then um it's interesting because it like it's uh on moriarty and instead of um on sherlock which is good to get some insider info yeah we can take more yard down easier because we'll have the insider info and uh yeah yeah i really don't watch that one too and then um i'll probably check out like a few others just to see um i really like uh guess for an example i really liked hinamat city um that's a really funny anime if you guys haven't seen it um but it's like it was like a smaller one and it's just like a you know funny slice of life a slice of life yeah i really like the comedy and hinamat city is really funny uh so there's any other ones um airing this season that have uh good comedy yeah uh i'll definitely watch that one yeah if there's any others like that yeah okay uh next question thank you hi mila hello i've noticed your accent waxing and waning it has made me question your claims of being british i have to hide my british accent so that my real identity doesn't get found uh please pronounce the following words to prove you are truly british okay i like this a challenge  jaguar jaguar jaguar what's the shaya warchestershire what was the sire or just the sia okay thank you next question thanks for supporting hollow stars the other day which holostar members are your favorite uh i like w and uh estelle yeah all of them are really nice and uh they're all cute and you guys should take them out and yeah yeah they all look really nice and they're very uh entertaining yeah uh next question thank you if you could have a superpower what would it be well i already have a superpower because i can time travel and my amazing detective skills also count almost as a superpower pretty much um if i had another superpower though i think i would pick either invisibility or teleportation yeah because like what if you want a kit kat but you don't have any kit kats but you have teleportations you just and you uh go into the store when it's closed and then you take a kitkat and then you leave and then you have a kitkat and you can eat it for later yeah or you can go invisible and spy on people not in a lewd way just in general like have you ever oh yeah yeah yeah do you guys ever like going to like uh where they show they have open houses and you get to like walk around somebody's house and you get to like see the layout of the house and stuff i think that's really interesting yeah if i was able to go invisible i would just enter into people's homes just to see what they look like and like see the architecture from inside if they were like really interesting looking homes yeah that would be cool yeah okay next question thank you uh how did you learn the call-outs for all the maps in uh valerian and cs go those sorts of things are always the toughest for me to know um well although i don't do it um on stream using voice chat uh when you play the game is a really good um way to learn call-outs and even if you don't know the call-outs like uh i think i think uh what really helps me i used to not speak that much at all but um playing games and talking to people online really helped my speech skills so even if you're nervous about it um at least when you're playing a game you have an objective so you can try to talk to your teammates and try to say uh oh up there there's one up there around the corner and then you can say oh what is that called does anybody know the call out for that and then somebody will tell you because somebody else probably knows and then also if you just want to learn the callouts um well that might not stuffy um you should watch uh some some pro casted tournaments yeah they use a lot of the call-outs in the tournaments um and even watching just like uh a casual or um you know somebody who wants to be pro streaming yeah uh they'll use a lot of call-outs especially if they're communicating with their team which they usually are um you know at higher levels of gameplay there's more communication with the teams uh so yeah watch some streams and uh there's also i know there's also videos actually that do like uh call outs for the maps yeah when i was on uh i i i was on a small overwatch team for a while and we would play like in some tournaments and like small tournaments you know and um we would like go over uh each map we'd go over each map and we would uh learn the call out so we could properly call it out yeah so yeah there's videos uh watch streams watch tournaments talk to your teammates yeah thank you next question  oh uh this is the end we already read this question okay well uh i didn't really pick out uh as many questions today because i was late um there were a total of 3 100 uh questions in my marshmallow uh unfortunately i think i only got like 30 of them today yeah but we'll do more next week and uh sorry it was so short today but uh i do believe ina is still streaming uh call it cthulhu unless you stop

is it mayo it's not mayo mayo is only good on a sandwich and just a little bit of mayo my favorite condiment um sometimes i like to mix ketchup and ranch together it makes crunch and then you dip french fries in it that's really good i like to dip french fries in crunch and i usually just do ketchup like on a hot dog or ketchup on a hamburger yeah what do you mean ew it's good you guys should try it crunch is good ketchup and ranch it's yummy it turns into like orange ranch or like pink now you guys should try it stop saying ew you don't even know you don't even know  uh i also have had like burgers that have had like uh what is it thousand island sauce or dressing or something that's good too that's yummy yeah um with chicken barbecue sauce good too i like barbecue sauce um yeah mainly just ketchup though pretty plain yeah ketchup and ranch okay next question thank you what combination of gamer grub and gamer fuel do you recommend so i can do pro gaming like you well recently i stocked up on um hot pockets and swedish meatballs those are pretty good for hot pockets i like the four cheese one um but i accidentally got the meatball ones um so it's meatballs and meatballs and meatballs yeah meatballs pretty good um thank you next question good luck on your pro gaming will you go on a date with me uh funny you ask actually we have a members only date it's not actually a date but i mean it is it's not it is it is it's not um we're gonna go to the arcade and have a nice dinner afterwards  okay thank you for the question next  uh you guys are so adorable thank you what is your first impression of hollywood members and after getting along with each other for almost one month is there any changes on the impression um actually i've gotten this question a lot like what were your initial impressions on everybody else but i have really bad memories i actually don't remember like thinking anything in particular like oh this person comes off like this uh but i'll say um before we we we started playing games together i was really nervous to like uh well i was still pretty nervous to do like collabs and stuff because i'm not used to like playing um games with people that much and it it makes me really nervous yeah but i still try my best and uh yeah i think it's worth it like it's worth uh going out of my comfort zone because i have a lot of fun doing the collabs yeah especially like uh doing like one-on-one collabs and stuff that that made me really nervous too but um so far uh you know having having games to play and stuff helps because uh if it was just one-on-one talking i don't know it kind of scares me it's it's kind of scary uh but yeah everybody has been really nice and and fun to play with and i look forward to the future where we can all play a ton of games together anyways yeah sorry it doesn't really answer your question my memory is pretty bad uh but thank you next question how does it feel not being hydrodynamic well you see good uh she's hydrodynamic but she needs floaties now me i don't need any floaties i got two big ones thank you for the question next hello detectives i love your streams thank you thank you uh and one question reminds us of you why are you dressed like sherlock holmes aren't you the watson well buy blood i may be a watson but in my heart in my brain i am a sherlock you guys agree right number one detective in hollow life yet  right anna thank you for the question next how long have you been playing games and what is your very first pc game that you play thank you uh i've been playing games uh for as long as i can remember pretty much yeah part of my training as a detective has been um you know training virtually with the games and uh very first pc game i remember do you guys remember this game um elf bowling you guys play that i played it on like a real one of those really old chunky laptops that had the little eraser nub in the middle no it's a weird game it was like um it's like it's like a i don't know i don't know how to describe it it's like kind of a funny game but the comedy was like really weird and there were like naked elves or something i remember it was weird and also pinball pinball on the computer yeah uh also can you find joe um yeah i found joe actually he was with your mama i guess you could say  yo mama  next question thank you can you make a microwave impression uh i can try yeah okay let me take some tea first okay  beep  beep beep beep beep and your food is ready  okay next question how do you like your eggs fried scrambled or fertilized who eats eggs like that what um i like the sunny side up but over easy where it's like still uh kind of cooked on the top but the inside's still gooey yeah all right next question thank you uh do you parents don't value being a youtuber if yes what are their reaction um in this timeline uh since my parents are also time travelers uh are currently not in this timeline but uh auntie watson um she always said if you wanted to be a clown i will support you i will help you get into clown school and i will root for you to be the best clown you can ever be and well here i am  um but uh auntie watson has always been very supportive yeah kind of like a spider-man and like aunt may yeah yeah um and then and then and then i really appreciate all all like the support because uh it it's like my turn to take care of her now you know what i mean and i don't need to live an extravagant detective lifestyle i can lead a simple detective life and as long as i can take care of her that makes me happy yeah our next question thank you uh why is your name pronounced as a me shouldn't it be be pronounced as amy uh well if you look at the katakana spelling my name amelia  and if it was pronounced amy it'd be spelled with me  what should i wear for our date tonight um well i will also be dressed in business casual um since we are members investigators this is a transaction uh business casual recommended business cash it's very wide i mean you can wear jeans with business casual you can wear a nice button-up shirt and wear a nice dress nice cocktail dress  all right next question if you're in here right now answering a random questions from strangers on the internet what would you be doing uh probably sleeping yeah probably sleeping uh for like another well actually today i slept i slept for almost nine hours i probably if i didn't have to wake up i probably would have slept for like 12 hours uh yeah probably uh yeah probably sleeping sleeping or reading in bed thank you next question hi amit hello it has come to my attention that hello live is mostly a cat loving oriented place a lot of your senpais and the jp burns are a happy owner of cats and they all have several uh they all have talked about cats several times but i feel dog presence is severely lacking that is until you can't please tell us more about your dog bubba and what do you like in your pets cheers cheers cheers love uh i actually have a cat too um but for my pets um well i think i think uh it's kind of hard to take care of three pets um alone but for me it also really helps like to make a schedule for myself because i know you know every day i have to take care of them and that's what gets me out of out of bed sometimes you know um knowing that they're relying on me um and i want to give them like the best the best stuff possible because you know dogs need exercise and they need um attention and training and cats need exercise and attention and food and well they all need food and water so uh yeah uh does that answer the question um i look for anything particular in pests no just uh little cuddly cuties all of them yeah uh how did you get so good at gales and how can i be good um we just got to put a lot of hours into into playing yeah i used to play for you know like six to nine hours a day straight uh it's kind of hard to find that that sort of time especially if you're a busy busy detective like me and uh yeah the more time you put into it the better you'll be especially if you're not used to playing with mouse and keyboard the only way you'll get better is by by spending time playing how do i find the motivation do stuff and be happy oh i don't i don't know i don't know about the be happy one but for motivation ah for me  i like the taste of tea like uh when i'm not drinking tea i can taste the tea i love tea okay thank you uh good luck and uh i believe in you you can do it thank you for a question i'm next hello emme hi i love the streams thank you you said uh you do watch alongs for members i was wondering if they're going to be movie exclusives or some anime thrown in um i think for the first few ones they'll just be like probably probably like a movie then um i thought it'd be cool to watch like a documentary but i don't want to do like anything too serious so i'll see what i can find and then probably another movie i'd be interested in doing um some anime but for i feel like for anime it's harder to find you know like um uh a uh a legit way yeah to watch yeah for movies it's easier because you have like netflix and stuff um so yeah the documentary would be really nice yeah uh but yeah probably since this week we're doing the arcade and asmr i think next week we'll do watch along i haven't decided yet but it'll probably be uh something detective themed um yeah or mystery theme suspense i want to watch like some action some action movies uh oh i was thinking for some reason i don't know why i want to watch something with like robert de niro maybe like a mafia movie or something or like a gang movie i don't know okay um thank you for the question uh next yeah the stream is lagging i'll wait until it's gone  i think it's my internet oh yeah i haven't seen i haven't seen the second batman movie with joker i haven't seen that one that'd be cool to watch i watched the first one for the first time like uh like six months ago or something yeah it's my internet little it'll just wait ah the ice melted it's diluting my tea yeah i think that's the christopher nolan one i don't know i don't know actors names i'm really bad with names okay it seems like the like has gotten better now little bump on the internet road um okay  oh he's the director oh yeah the director yeah yeah see i knew yeah uh okay next please tell us about your dreams and the waves well usually when i have bad dreams like i have these dreams where there's these giant like foot tall waves this is actually i have a i probably have like a wave related dream like maybe one or two times a week um i had a yeah i'll be like on a beach or something or it'll be like this little tiny beach and then a big wave will come is really scary um and then also actually last night i had a dream i had a dream where i was making a game i was like going around and designing a game it was like a diner dash game except it was like a gouda themed diner dash game probably because we had the club it was like it was like a beach themed uh gouda diner dash game that i was designing and then i was like wait a second but chiara would be most likely the one to have like a diner dash game um you know because she has her restaurant chain uh so then i started making a kiara diner dash game and then it turned into like this this dream where i was in my old detective school and uh the detective school was being shut down because it was being turned into a ninja warrior course and then there was an assassin and i was trying to throw knives and i was practicing knife throwing with like all these different types of pocket knives and then some of them were really bad for knife throwings and i picked out some good ones for knife throwing and then  that's pretty much it yeah anyways uh uh thank you for the question next i am always so upbeat and positive every stream so i'm wondering what the secret to your boundless energy is  thank you um um for my detective work i i don't know how to describe it's like flipping a switch like um it's all about the mindset but it takes a while to cultivate that sort of mindset um yeah i don't know i don't know how else to describe it's just like uh in the zone you know in the zone i don't know uh yeah yeah you gotta be in the mindset the right mindset you have to cultivate your mindset okay anyways thank you next question what was the most disappointing uh ending to a great book movie or game um actually well i wouldn't say it's a great book movie or game but there was this um it was a a k drama that i was watching and it involved time travel actually and it was about like this girl like she found this um watch on the beach and it was like let her go back in time like you know for an hour or something and then but the more she used it the more she used it the older she would get so like um eventually there were okay it's kind of spoilers okay but you know she was trying to save somebody and she kept failing and so she kept going back and back and back and back again and again and again and trying to save them and then the next day she woke up after she stayed them and she was like 60 years old and she was like you know she's like 20 and she became 60 overnight and then they like built up this whole thing where you think you know she's like trying to get back to to her age but then it turns out that everything that you had just watched was like not true at all and then it turned out to be like uh it was all it was all a dream but she was actually an old lady in like a hospital and it was all like part of her her alzheimer's dream or something it was so lame it really pissed me off anyways um next thank you uh hello good day good day to you too sir or madame do you like chocolate uh white or dark chocolate i don't like chocolate um i guess it's pretty plain because i just like milk chocolate um white chocolate i mean is white chocolate even chocolate it doesn't taste like chocolate at all it's just like cream thick cream i like dark chocolate sometimes like have you guys ever had the um you know those fancy gold wrapped chocolates the ferrero rocher uh the dark chocolate ones of those are really really really really really really really good yeah i think that's the only dark chocolate that i like yeah the ferrero rocher dark chocolates are really good  thank you um next question amelia thanks for all the hard work and the great laughs thank you i'm glad you enjoyed the stream when you're a kid what job did you want to have when you grew up uh what do you think your child self would say now you're streaming a detective superstar um well before i knew i was a time traveler um of course i was always raised as a watson to follow the watson path and continue pursue a doctor um doctorate yes my pdf but aside from that i always wanted to do like uh what i always wanted to be i feel like this is a pretty common answer actually i really liked watching steve irwin and i wanted to become like a marine biologist yeah i wanted to work with animals because i like animals a lot and uh you know maybe in the future that's still still uh you know detective work um you know being a doctor being animal doctor or something you know i could do both at the same time uh anyways yeah i always wanted to work with animals like be a zoologist or something i don't know well here i am uh hard working detective you know even as you get older there's still many paths in life available to you uh yeah it's never too late it's never too late okay uh thank you for the question uh next as penalty for missing the overcooked collab can you tell us an embarrassing story uh i guess it's only fair right i guess it's only fair um well there was uh a few years back i i uh well um i was a working undercover at uh you guys probably know this right at um this big convention called uh e3 i was working undercover for company and uh somebody asked me a question somebody asked me a question while i was undercover and they were asking about a certain console that was um being uh made available and i replied uh now you guys have all heard of a sega genesis but have you heard of the jaga senesis because that's what i said i said i said jager senesis loud to a person who is asking me a question is really embarrassing uh i stutter a lot i do stutter a lot and after that my face got really red that was really embarrassing yeah uh there's also that that during that same undercover operation i was talking to some people and apparently they were co-workers and you know one of them was like an older guy and the other guy was like not so old and so i asked them if they were father and son but they were just co-workers and you should never ask people that you don't know if they're father and son because they looked really insulted and then they stopped talking to me after that so don't ask people that question okay okay  uh anyways being in the public uh i'd rather stay inside anyways thank you for the question next uh if you could erase the memories of the story of one game movie anime manga or show and re-experience it again for the first time what would it be and why uh i was actually caught between two games um either fallout or bioshock but i think bioshock because fallout fallout is good and even if you replay it it'll be good but for bioshock because uh when you first play there's something about the atmosphere that like catches you off guard i guess when you play it for the first time like a combination of the atmosphere and the music and like learning the mechanics and stuff and like uh following the story but with fallout because there's so much lore i guess and fallout i feel like you can replay it and still learn new things but for bioshock yeah i wish i could replay all the bioshock games one two and infinite yeah i like to replay them without remembering them that would be fun i like bioshock too yeah  i'll probably play i'll probably replay one of the fallouts at some point uh maybe maybe we can't because of the radio but it might have to be like um an archive stream maybe but yeah all right thank you for the question next uh this is called detective diaries and then why are you sharing it with us well because in chats we have the investigators and also some new detectives so this is as part of my detective work i think you know to help my fellow uh kohai detectives out um i'm sharing some some insider info with you guys yeah to help you be better detectives yeah thank you thank you for the question next um if you got stuck in a deserted island uh which hollow live en member would you want to get stuck with uh i thought about this a little bit yeah i mean you have gouda ah she can swim right it's an island so that's pretty useful that's pretty useful it's a pretty good skill uh wait no wait she can't swim she has floaties never mind good as useless never mind then we have inna and ina has tentacles those are pretty useful actually that would be really good yeah you can use her tentacles as um tools and you can like climb trees and get coconuts or something and like dig a bunch of holes for some reason uh then you have cali she has a size that'd be pretty good too you cut down trees with that you get some uh wild piggies or something uh get some food and then you have kiara who you can just kill over and over again and eat her delicious body i would like to go with chiara so i can have unlimited chicken  she's a phoenix it's fine she'll just rise again yeah probably the tentacles well all of those are good options aside from getting  yeah probably kiara yeah all right uh thank you for the question uh next amelia hello weird hypothetical but what if you were offered uh by management to live alongside the other halloween girls would you accept yeah spasms phobia is pretty cool multiplayer horror game i'll be sure to check it out uh yeah gooda told me about emphasmophobia she seemed like really excited about it so hopefully we can play that at some point i hear it's really scary and uh yeah that would be fun uh living alongside everyone that would be really cool that'd be really nice because then we could we could all play games together on the couch and stuff and uh that would be really cool but i have bubba and mickey and wellington and uh it's not really fair to other people to be like now you have to deal with these animals because you know not everybody wants that responsibility or like you know bubba barks sometimes and you know not everybody is prepared for that so yeah um uh it would be fun but i don't know yeah bubba yeah yeah maybe not but thank you for the question uh next uh are you bringing back japanese practice streams again i'm not sure if you read all these but hope you saw a previous one it's kind of about looking to native shark and jlpt uh thank you great resources um yeah i would like to especially because hold on yeah i would like to i think it would really help me especially if i do it while streaming because then um then i'll actually get to it because like uh if i try to do stuff on my own when i'm not streaming i get really distracted and i just do other stuff instead um so i think if i if i if i did it as a stream it would be kind of hard i have to like really plan it out to make sure i'm actually doing something and like actually learning at the same time uh but yeah i was planning to i know on my last japanese stream so people left some comments about better resources and stuff so yeah i'm planning on uh going going to check there again and getting some uh newer better resources to uh practice with yeah bubba stream is every stream every stream was in yeah i thank you for the question all next hello watson hello teammate uh do you ever drink hot tea or do you prefer cold tea does it depend on what type of tea you're drinking um i don't like hot drinks and i don't like hot fruit i like cold drinks and i like cold fruit and i got my cold tea here  ice yeah iced tea cold drinks  i don't like hot water i don't like hot coffee or hot tea i don't really like hot chocolate either i like gold  all right thank you next question  if you could control one element which would you choose water earth fire or air um i feel like uh fire would be really cool fire would be well i guess it would be pretty hot uh fire would be really cool but then i feel like uh personality wise i'm probably more like a water yeah probably more like a water type you guys say air what do you guys think i am what kind of type do you think i am and you can't just be the avatar salt that's not an element i see everything but earth oh there we go some earth um lewd type that's not an element either drug poison hey  okay i'm gonna go with wait earth would be really cool too because then you could just build a house  uh but then with air you could like fly i don't know that's a hard question uh i go with water i go with the water it's simple if i think about it too much there's just too many there's too many uh pros and cons well mostly pros for everyone okay air because of hiccup oh i gotta have a special hiccup move i could kill my enemies with hiccups  water has salt in it sometimes so yeah that fits all right thank you next question do you play an instrument i'm glad you asked i have prepared something for you today i said i would do it during karaoke but then i forgot okay i practiced a little bit but if i mess up that's just how it is i'm sorry i'll probably start again from the top if i mess up okay i have something to show you guys we'll put on the echo okay be prepared ready this is the only song i remember how to play too   do hold on  do  i don't remember the rest hold on damn it i practiced beforehand it's scary playing in front of people i give up i give up hold on let me try one last part  yeah i don't remember i'll practice again we'll come back to it next time i had it i did the full thing before the stream and now i started streaming and now i can't remember it's scary to play in front of other people i'm sorry i had it i'll do better next time all right next question thank you uh who are your top three golden kamui characters the anime is great with the comedy from the manga some of this stuff can't be shown in the anime though hey i plan on reading the manga probably after this season because uh who knows how long it'll be till the next season comes out um but my top three golden kamui characters uh i really like shiraishi um because he's he's funny but like also useful and he's kind of stupid and that's why i like him and then i like sugimata is pretty pretty standard answers i guess but i like sugi mata um because uh i don't know he's really passionate you know and cute and then my third favorite character is actually oh got that because um he's voiced by a voice actually i really like uh kenjiro  yeah um he's kind of the character is kind of like a psychopath but i still like him  yeah thank you for the question anyone purpose in life sorry for the deep question um actually even if i answer this one it doesn't really matter because nobody can tell you that answer you gotta find it for yourself or else it doesn't have a purpose i could tell you the perfect answer right now but it's not gonna mean anything because you have to come to that realization yourself for it to have meaning it's the journey that makes it uh have purpose all right thank you next question i have a favorite dog breed um actually uh i had a dog and we we grew up together like uh when when i was a small wee time traveler in the belly um the doggy was also like uh apparently doggy used to like as a puppy sleep on on my mom's belly when i was in the belly and uh yeah we are really close close doggy friends and he was a  on frise yeah i really like to be zombies hey yeah they're fluffy they're like um
